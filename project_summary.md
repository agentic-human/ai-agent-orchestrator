#  Multi-Agent AI Orchestrator with CrewAI

##  Project Overview

This project implements a multi-agent AI system using [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/) to coordinate a group of specialized agents for solving high-level user tasksâ€”such as researching stock market trends. Each agent plays a specific role in the pipeline, and tasks are executed in a logical sequence to produce a final written report.

    MetaAgent["Meta Agent<br>Oversees agent coordination"]

    subgraph Agents [ ]
        direction LR
        DataAnalyst["Data Analyst<br>Collects raw information"]

    end

    WebSearch["Web Search Tool"]

    %% Control flow: meta assigns tasks to each agent
    MetaAgent ==> DataAnalyst
    MetaAgent ==> AnalysisAgent
    MetaAgent ==> WriterAgent

```

### ðŸ‘¥ Agents

- **Data Analyst (`data_agent`)**
  - Collects raw information via web search.
- **Analyst (`analysis_agent`)**
  - Analyzes and synthesizes collected data.
- **Technical Writer (`writer_agent`)**
  - Writes a coherent report from the analysis.

###  Meta Agent Orchestration

- A `meta_agent` oversees task delegation using an `assign_agents()` function.
- Tasks are defined with descriptive strings and mapped to the appropriate agents.

###  Execution Flow

1. User inputs a high-level task.
2. Agents and their tasks are assigned via the meta agent.
3. A `Crew` is created with the agents and tasks.
4. The `crew.kickoff()` method executes the workflow.
5. Final output is returned to the user.

##  Final Outcome

The orchestrator now:
- Accepts a task from the user.
- Coordinates agent roles via a meta agent.
- Executes a research-analysis-writing pipeline.
- Returns a summarized output of stock market activity or any other topic.

```
User Input â†’ Task 1 (Web Search) â†’ Task 2 (Analysis) â†’ Task 3 (Report Writing) â†’ Output
```

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add a Planner Agent to dynamically determine tasks.
- [ ] Add a Manager Agent to dynamically assign agents.
- [ ] Integrate toolchains or API discovery for deeper analysis (e.g., stock API querying).
- [ ] Add feedback loops or memory for stateful agents.

##  Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11**
- **CrewAI** (multi-agent orchestration)
- **Pydantic** (validation)
- **Custom Agent Modules** (`data_agent`, `analysis_agent`, `writer_agent`)
- **WebSearchTool** (for live data collection)

##  Errata

### Incompatible Package Versions (CrewAI & LangChain)
- **Issue**: CrewAI required a newer version of LangChain than what was initially installed, leading to errors when calling LangChain-based tools or integrations.
- **Symptoms**: Attribute errors or import issues when using LangChain wrappers inside CrewAI agents or tools.
- **Fix**: Aligned versions by upgrading both packages using:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade crewai langchain
  ```
and verified compatibility with the latest stable versions listed in both repos.

### `BaseTool` vs `Tool` Import Loop
- **Issue**: Confusion over whether to use `BaseTool` or `Tool` from `crewai.tools`. The documentation and examples had inconsistencies.
- **Loop**:
  - Initial attempt used `Tool`, which caused import or runtime errors.
  - Switched to `BaseTool`, which was not directly usable or lacked required interfaces.
  - Backtracked to `Tool`, but required correct class structure and dependencies like `args_schema`.
- **Fix**: Used the correct tool instantiation from CrewAI examples (`WebSearchTool`), avoiding manual `Tool` subclassing altogether.

###  Type Handling
- **Issue**: Passed `verbose=2` (invalid type).
- **Fix**: Corrected to `verbose=True`.

###  Attribute Errors
- **Issue**: Attempted to access nonexistent attributes like `agent.alias`.
- **Fix**: Removed or updated print statements to reference valid agent properties.

###  Crew Initialization
- **Issue**: Incorrect or missing parameters during `Crew()` instantiation.
- **Fix**: Ensured all required fields were included and valid.

###  API Mismatch
- **Issue**: Called `crew.run()` which is outdated.
- **Fix**: Replaced with `crew.kickoff()` (current CrewAI API method).
